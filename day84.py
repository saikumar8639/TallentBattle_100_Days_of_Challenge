Day 84 coding Statement : 

Given an undirected graph and an integer M. The task is to determine if the graph can be colored with at most M colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color. Here coloring of a graph means the assignment of colors to all vertices. Print 1 if it is possible to colour vertices and 0 otherwise.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
M = 3
E = 5
Edges[] = {(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(0,2)}

Output: 1
Explanation: It is possible to colour the given graph using 3 colours.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
M = 2
E = 3
Edges[] = {(0,1),(1,2),(0,2)}
Output: 0
